Group project on covid lockdowns, dataset found on Gouvernement du Québec's website. Part 2 was my contribution.  

### Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing the impact of specific events related to the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of confirmed cases in Quebec, Canada.  
The project is divided into three parts, each examining the effects of a different event. This condensed description is presented in a simple and easy-to-understand manner,  
without delving into technical details. 

### The three parts are as follows:  
#### 1. The 20/3/2020 lockdown (MooJin)
This section analyzes the impact of the lockdown implemented on 20th March 2020 on the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Quebec.  
The analysis includes data visualization and statistical tests to determine the statistical relationship between the periods before and after the lockdown.  
The results suggest a correlation between the lockdown and a decrease in the number of confirmed cases.

#### 2. The reopening of schools on 31/8/2020 (René)
This section examines the effects of the reopening of schools on 31st August 2020 on the number of new COVID-19 cases in Quebec.  
The analysis includes data visualization and regression analysis to compare the trends before and after the reopening.  
The findings indicate an increase in the number of daily new cases following the reopening of schools.

#### 3. The 25/12/2020 lockdown (Shirley)
This section focuses on the impact of the lockdown implemented on 25th December 2020 on the number of COVID-19 cases in Quebec.  
The analysis includes data visualization and regression analysis to assess the trend before and after the lockdown.  
The results suggest a potential correlation between the lockdown and the stabilization of the number of COVID-19 cases.

Please note that the analysis in these sections is presented in a simplified manner to provide a clear understanding of the effects of each event.  
The analysis utilizes statistical tests and regression analysis to draw conclusions based on the available data.
